# hello-world
First GitHub activity

Hey GitHub,

I'm Alex, and I'm here to start my GitHub portfolio, looking towards learning C#, SQL, JavaScript, and Python.
One of my personal interests, outside of coding, is music theory. I find the fundamentals of any topic vastly interesting to understand,
and music is easily the most interesting to me.
